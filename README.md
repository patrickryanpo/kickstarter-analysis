# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this report is to aid Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals by using the Kickstarter dataset. The key data points and analysis in this report will enable a deeper understanding of kickstarter campaigns in the theater and plays category. Through understanding the results presented, Louise will be able to make more effective decisions for her future kickstarter campaigns in the aforementioned categories. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The main factors represented in this report are theater outcomes by launch date and play outcomes based on their fundraising goals. 

A size of 1,369 Kickstarter campaigns were used for the data reflected in theater outcomes by launch date:

A size of 1,047 Kickstarter plays were used for the data reflected in plays based on funraising goals:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As represented in the graph above, Kickstarter campaigns in the theater campaigns had the highest success rate were launched in the month of May with a success rate of 67%. This is followed by June that has a success rate of 65%. Another notable observation from the data presented is that the volume of theater campaigns were highest during May and June at 166 and 153, respectively. Despite the high success rate during these months, marketing of the campaigns may pose as a big factor for success due to the high number of campaigns launched on these months. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes vs Goals](https://github.com/patrickryanpo/photolibrary/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

As shown in the graph above, majority of the kickstarter campaigns in the plays subcategory were in the goal range of $1,000 to $4,999, which reflected a success rate of 73%. Kickstarter play campaigns with fundraising goals under $1,000 posed as the most successful campaigns across all funding categories at 76%. It is also notable that kickstart play campaigns in the $35,000-$39,999 and $40,000 to $49,999 ranges displayed a 67% success rate. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

More data and representation is needed to draw significant conclusions as data points could not be attributed to the behaviors and preferences of campaign backers. By understanding investors data, we could come up with more conclusive results for this project. The sample size provided in the data set is limited to campaigns from 2009 to 2017, which may pose as a threat when making conclusions based on the current year. Especially in 2020, the theater landscape has taken a huge turn due to the pandemic. These challenges may be overcome by expanding the data collected from kickstarter campaigns. Data that would significantly help results would be genre of theater productions, age demographic of backers, and seasonality of productions. Getting a deeper understanding of the theater campaigns would significantly enhance the accuracy of the results. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  - The month of May is the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign in the play category. At the same time, it       is also the month with the most campaigns launched so getting noticed may require more effort. 
  
  - Kickstarter campaigns in the theater category posed most challenging when launched in the months of December       and October with a success rate of 49% and 57%, respectively. Louise should avoid launching her campaigns on       these months based on the data provided. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  - It can be concluded that Kickstarter campaigns in the plays category are most successful when the fundraising       goal is under $1,000. Trailing this is the category of $1,000 to $4,999, which has a success rate of 73%.           Funding goals in these ranges are recommended for small productions. 
  
  - For higher production campaigns, it is recommended for Louise to stick within the $35,000 to $44,999 range,         which reflected a success rate of 67%. 
  
  - Louise should avoid starting a campaign with funding goals of $20,000 to $29,999 as campaigns in this funding       cateogry posed a failure rate of 80%. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  - The dataset does not reflect the genre and categories of the plays produced. It may be possible for specific       genre's to be more popular than others in the theater and plays category. The data provided is only from 2009-     2017, which may not reflect behavioral changes in the recent years. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  
  - A possible category to include would be the genres of each play and the familiarity of the funders to the           title of the play being produced. However, additional data would have to be provided or extracted from the         campaign's name or blurb. 
  
  - We could also have segmented the success based on country. Depending on where Louise would want to produce her     play, it would be important to know geographically audiences would be most interested.
